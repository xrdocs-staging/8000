# Introduction
The Cisco 8000 Series combines the revolutionary Cisco Silicon One™, IOS XR® software, and a set of clean sheet chassis to deliver a breakthrough in high-performance routers. 
High-performance networking systems have historically been divided into routing or switching classes, with distinct hardware and software. But, as the necessity for reliable networks proliferates, it is imperative that traditional networks shift to a new architecture to address exponential bandwidth needs, ubiquitous connectivity, security, better quality of service, low latency coupled with high reliability, availability, and serviceability of the infrastructure. The Cisco® 8000 Series portfolio completes this journey with the Cisco 8700 products.
The Cisco 8700 series is an addition to [the Cisco 8000 Series Routers](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/routers/8000-series/index.html) powered by [Cisco Silicon One](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/silicon-one/index.html)™  ASICs.  8700 products embody this cutting-edge innovation of the 8000 portfolio, offering advanced features engineered for seamless integration and scalability. Whether enhancing existing infrastructure or enabling new capabilities, the 8700 series products empower organizations to achieve their goals with unmatched efficiency and effectiveness. 

# Cisco 8711-32FH-M Overview  
Cisco 8711-32FH-M is a 1RU 12.8T fixed system based on a single P100 ASIC. With 16 ports of QSFP-DD800 and 16 ports of QSFP56-DD on the faceplate, Cisco 8711-32FH-M uses only 4 of the 6 slices of the P100, optimizing for higher scale and a broader L2 feature set than is currently capable on Q200 based fixed systems.
